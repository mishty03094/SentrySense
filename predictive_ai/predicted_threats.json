Given that the vulnerability allows for root access via a commonly known command and the infrastructure includes a legacy CentOS 7 system running FTP, this significantly increases exploitability.  Since the affected system, file-server-01, is present in the described infrastructure and is potentially running a vulnerable FTP service, the relevance to the organization is high.  Therefore, a high confidence score is assigned although the age of the CVE might imply it's already addressed in modern systems, and a lack of specifics regarding the FTP server software leaves slight uncertainty. However, the high potential impact outweighs this uncertainty.",

This means a user already having an account on the affected system could exploit a weakness in the system's restore functionality to gain root (administrator) privileges.  This vulnerability is extremely old and targets a very outdated operating system.  Modern systems (like those listed in the infrastructure) are not directly vulnerable, as they are based on significantly newer operating systems and have undergone extensive security updates.

This vulnerability allows a local attacker with user-level access to exploit a flaw in how the system handles excessively long input strings for the shell or GECOS (user information) fields in the `/etc/passwd` file. By providing unusually long data, the attacker could overwrite adjacent memory areas, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution and granting them root privileges on the affected system.
